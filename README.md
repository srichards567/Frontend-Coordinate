# Coordinate Frontend
### Technologies Used
1. React.js
2. Microservices
3. PostgreSQL

### General Approach
I started with creating the back-end using microservices. I started with the eureka-server, then created the api-gateway and two services - one for users and one for events. During the initialization of all the modules in the back-end I had some issues with generating a target folder for each module, so I decided to move on to creating my react app. <br />

I had to change my initial project structure for many reasons. First, I had to create two new repositories - one for the front-end and one for the back-end - because of an error with uploading my first react app into GitHub repository and also after learning that it is good practice to keep code for the front and back-end separate. I also decided to change my website idea from something based on event planning to a site where people can submit posts.

### Major Hurdles and Unsolved Problems
My major hurdles:
1. Generating folders for back-end modules for them to build successfully

Unsolved Problems:
1. Only one of my services (users-api) from the back-end would build successfully after composing.
2.
